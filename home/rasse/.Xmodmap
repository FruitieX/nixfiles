! A Dvorak layout for Finnish/Swedish keyboards, by Kimmo Kulovesi.
! http://arkku.com/dvorak
!
! Load with xmodmap, e.g., "xmodmap arkkudvorak.xmodmap".
!
! If you get errors for unrecognized symbols, simply delete those words
! from this file, then try again. Not all X11 implementations support
! all the same symbols. If the layout loads but the mappings are
! incorrect (i.e. not as they should be for Dvorak), your platform has
! incompatible keycodes. Restore your original layout (e.g., with setxkbmap)
! and use "xmodmap -pke" to find out what your keycodes are, then modify
! the codes in this file accordingly.
!
! Before trying this layout for the first time, it is a good idea to
! set up your system with a command to switch back to the previous
! layout aymatically in case something goes wrong. For example, you could
! run "sleep 60 && setxkbmap fi" to revert after 60 seconds.
!
! On many systems renaming this file ~/.Xmodmap causes it to auto-load
! on X11 login.
